      Satay, (known as <em>sate</em> in Indonesian) is a very popular food in Indonesia with a rich variety among Indonesia's diverse ethnic groups' culinary
      art. Indonesia is the home of satay, and satay is a widely renowned dish in almost all regions across the nation. As a result, many variations have been
      developed throught the Indonesian Archipelago. Satay may have originated in Java, but it is also popular in many other Southeast Asian countries, such as:
      Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, as well as in The Netherlands which was influenced through its former colonies. In Indonesia, satay can be obtained
      from a travelling satay vendor, from a street-side tent-restaurant, in an upper-class restaurant, or during traditional celebration feasts.
