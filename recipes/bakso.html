      In Indonesia, meatballs are called 'bakso' and are usually served in a bowl, like soup, with noodles, beancurds(tofu), egg and siomay. It's a very popular
      food across the country. You can find it in every region in Indonesia, from street-side vendors, three feet of the cart or two feet of the vendor to nice
      restaurants.

      For Indonesian, bakso can be eaten as a snack or main dish. We don't need to make it at home because a lot of bakso sellers were passing by in front of
      the house everyday. Mostly they sell bakso daging sapi, made from beef.
